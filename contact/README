************************       ABOUT THE FILES          ************************

    The main.py does the job. Use "main.py -c command_file_name" to run it.

    Sample input commands are in file "cmd". Please feel free to modify it or
    you can create your own one.

    Frames are defined in files "contact_frame.yaml" "phone_frame.yaml"
    "text_frame.yaml" "email_frame.yaml" "ambiguous_frame.yaml"

    Lexicon is defined in the file "lexicon.yaml"

    Responses is saved in the file "response"




************************    HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS      ************************

    A sentence is tried to match a set of frames. If there is a match, the 
    reponse should be the one assigned to the matched frame. 




************************       ABOUT THE FRAMES         ************************

    Frames are grouped into different responses which are grouped into different
    tasks in different files. A frame is simply an ordered list of ontologies 
    representing sentences that share semantic structures. For example, 
    sentences requesting for someone's phone number can have a frame 
    "what/request/send person-name phone-number" under "SUCCEED CONTACT READY" 
    in the file "contact_frame.yaml".




************************       ABOUT THE LEXICON        ************************

    I made my little new lexicon because the original lexicon turns out hard to 
    use for the specific purpose of this program. 

    For example, "email" is defined only as "electronic mail" in its noun form, 
    while it could as well been used as short for "email address" in sentence 
    like "What's Bob's email?". 

    Another example would be that "contact", when used as a verb, is synonymous 
    to "call" "phone" in the original lexicon. This will cause unnecessary 
    trouble when someone try to distinguish a phone-related communication 
    establishing from a more general communication establishing. Besides, 
    "email" and "text", when used as verbs, can also mean establishing 
    communication, but they are not in the same synonym set as with "contact" 
    and "call".

    I think it's better, for each word in the lexicon, to clarify the range of 
    senses in a branch of ontology hierarchy that the word is able to express, 
    rather than assigning only one sense in an ontology branch to the word. This
    is because for some words, a word expresses a general sense in some cases 
    while it expresses a specific sense in other cases. In this way, it's easier
    to handle phrases such as "telephone call" "send email" interchangeably with
    single word of the same meaning "call" "email" respectively. You can see 
    some words defined with a range of hierarchical senses in the new lexicon.

    The new lexicon is far from fully covering the words and senses for contact 
    actions. It's rather an example to implement the ideas described above.
